@{
  archive    = "As I iterate on a project, or create new versions of a product, I move old code, designs, artwork in here. When I work on other people's products, I keep a copy of the original in here in case I mess things up."
  artwork    = "All project artwork goes in here, especially Photoshop and Illustrator master files. The idea is that anyone should be able to recreate all project image assets using the files in here. I often subdivide this folder with subfolders for the **product** master files, the **media** master files and **other** related master files."
  code       = "All source code goes in here. Since most projects contain more than one deliverable, there is a subfolder for each in here."
  data       = "A lot of projects involve client supplied data, which is saved here. I also save project system logs and data backups here so I can recreate issues or configure my development environment to match production."
  design     = "All design work happens in this folder. This almost always contains a research subfolder where all technical and competitive **research* goes. I also have a **pre-sales** subfolder for any design notes created as part of the project planning phase. Then I save all designs, wireframes and design notes in versioned subfolders here so I have a record of all design decisions."
  documents  = "This is the `"catch-all`" folder for documents that have no regular place in the structure. I mostly use it for the creation of knowledge-base documents, news articles, and as a place to store any other files related to the project."
  management = "Here we have copies of the contract, the statements of work, estimates, scheduling and planning documents, letters and correspondence, project reports, invoices and all other project management files."
  marketing  = "I really should call this the `"success`”, `"feel-good`” or `"shipped`” folder. In here I save any PR statements we send out (hence marketing folder) but also archives of any web articles on the project, any tweet mentions, any ranking screenshots, basically anything that is publicly said about the project. If we ever need a feel good moment, or a reality check, this folder has it all."
  media      = "Here we store all **presentations**, **brochures**, **screencasts**, **videos** and other media created to market or support the product. I often find it useful to create screencasts while making the project and sending them to clients so they can see the product as it grows."
  notes      = "I create a weekly markdown file where I log all the work I did on the project. It's an old habit but a goodie. All meeting notes, call notes, procedure notes and other ramblings are stored in markdown files in this folder. I always have BBEdit running with the latest assembly note open to jot down all that I do."
  partners   = "Many of our projects involve third parties, whether they be software vendors, designers or wordsmiths. Save all their deliverables and documents here so we have the originals. We can then create the project assets and masters from these files."
  support    = "If we make it, we have to support it. All support notes (that eventually become knowledge-base documents), bug reports, and templates go here."
  tools      = "Some projects rely on third party libraries, open source tools, or other products that may be needed to make it work. They go here."
